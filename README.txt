*FOR PEOPLE WHO USE MULTIPLE MEDICINAL PATCHES.


THIS SOFTWARE WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO A MAINTAIN AND OPTIMIZE A SCHEDULE FOR TRANSDERMAL ESTRODIAL PATCHES.
OFTEN PATCHES NEED TO BE CHANGED AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND CAN BE HARD TO REMEMBER WHICH PATCH WAS CHANGED WHEN.
THIS SOFTWARE KEEPS A SHEDULE OF YOUR CURRENT PATCH DATA.
THERE ARE TWO FUNCTIONS:  PATCHDAY AND NOTPATCHDAY
NOTPATCHDAY REVEALS YOUR CURRENT PATCHES AND RETURNS A REMINDER FOR WHEN TO CHANGE YOUR NEXT ONE AND WHAT PATCH TO CHANGE.
PATCHDAY WILL TELL YOU WHICH PATCH TO CHANGE, AND ONCE YOU'VE ACKNOWLEDGED IT'S CHANGED, IT WILL BE UPDATE YOUR SCHEDULE.
THERE IS A FEATURE FOR EMAILING YOU THE RESULTS AFTERWARD IN PATCHDAY.


:BUGS AND GENERAL IFFYNESS:

-CURRENTLY, FOR THE EMAIL FEATURE TO WORK, YOU MUST HAVE OUTLOOK INSTALLED AND BE LOGGED IN.
